# Naming Conventions - HTML & CSS

### Naming Convention
* Naming conventions are general rules applied when creating text scripts for software programming. They have many different purposes, such as adding clarity and uniformity to scripts, readability for third-party applications, and functionality in certain languages and applications. They range from capitalization and punctuation to adding symbols and identifiers to signify certain functions.

* In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

Reasons for using a naming convention include the following:

1. To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code
2. To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
3. To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.

### HTML & CSS Naming Conventions

* Always declare Document type 
* Use lowercase element names 
* Use lowercase attribute names
* Close all HTML Elements
* Always quotes attribute values
* Always specify alt, width, and height for images
* Blank lines and Identation
* HTML comments
* Using style sheets
* Use lower case file names
* File extensions
* The Block, Element, Modifier methodology (commonly referred to as BEM) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and **CSS** 
* Properly name CSS classes:
put the class name at the lowest possible level; use content to find a name; donâ€™t use camelCase; use fully descriptive words; try [] when too many classes of a kind; separate parent from children; avoid more than two words for a given name; single quote instead of double quote when declaring selector in HTML; etc.
