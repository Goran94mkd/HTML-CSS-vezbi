# Mobile First Design

* **Mobile first design** is a design strategy that says when you create a website or app, you should start sketching and prototyping the smallest screen first and work your way up to larger screens. <br>
Essentially, it’s about delivering the right user experience to the right device.


The reason that this makes sense is because with such limited real estate on small screens, UX designers must prioritize the most important aspects of their website and apps, namely content.

### The advantages
<br>
If you follow the mobile first strategy, you will benefit from many advantages. <br>
Firstly, Mobile First follows the current trend of the increase in mobile usage, as the mobile optimization happens at the beginning of the website design. The desktop version of a website can also benefit from mobile first, as it is not just a design approach - it is also a content-based approach, as only the most essential content is used. It is still possible to expand the site later without any problems.

### Criticism of mobile first
<br>

Critics believe that the concept of a website is very limited by the mobile-first-principle. Although many pages are now optimized for mobile user-friendliness, the user experience on desktop would also suffer because the usability would be unnecessarily uncomplicated.A further criticism is that pages created for mobile devices may appear to minimalistic in the desktop version.
