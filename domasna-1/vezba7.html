        <h1>My first website</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my first web. I'm still learning how to write webs, but I think I'm getting good at it.</p>
            <img src="https://www.howtodrawforkids.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/12-How-to-Draw-a-Man-for-Kids.jpg" style="height:175px">
        <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My name is Jack Bittner and I'm 20 years old. I attend a school in the United States.</p>
            <p>I like to read sometimes (mainly in summer) I play sports.</p>
            <p>My main hobby is (and I hope it will be my occupation soon too) <b>programming</b>!</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>In the first year I started with PASCAL. I was looking for some modern languages on the internet and I found ICT.social, where I've started learning <b>C#</b> and <b>Java</b>. I am able to develop simple applications so far</p>
            <p>This website is based on the HTML tutorials from <a style="color:purple" href="https://www.ict.social/html-css/first-website/images-and-links-in-html">ict.social</a>.</p>
